The former serves until there's someone to watch, the latter enables people to stay responsible at all point of time.\n\nAllowing people to follow their passion is definitely a way that would enable us to set up an environment that would promote peace.

Induction.\n2. Maintainance.\n3. Recovery.\n\n1. Induction: In this phase required/desired state of mind & body is required/desired quickly by short but fast acting drugs where in Cultural & Religious hypnosis required/desired state of mind & body is required/desired by two major natural, eternal & undetachable factors -ie- (1).Emotional attachment or bonding between child & parents.\n(2).Inter-dependence between child & parents. In childhood child is dependant on his parents & in adulthood parents are dependant. During such period of time the subconscious of any child is made which is hardly reversible, erasable & flashable just like ROM-BIOS in old computers. It is why so difficult for any one to change his cultural & religious inheritance -eg:\n- how much I become advanced but I can not eat frog, snake, tortoise etc, even though, being a doctor I know that these are not hazardous bioethically because these are being eaten somewheres in the world.\n\n2. Maintainance: In this phase, the period is required/desired according to procedure and is maintained by long acting drugs but in Cultural & Religious hypnosis maintainance is required/desired till the death of any person to live in his culture/religion with peace/harmony and is maintained by mainly parents recommended resources.\n\n3. Recovery: In anaesthesia recovery is required/desired imidiatly after the procedure to make person in normal state of mind but in Cultural/Religious hypnosis recovery is not still standardized universally where rational (Truth or Normal) & irrational (Myth or Abnormal) is indifferentiable.\n\nBut after the greatest discovery of ""Scientific Method"" it has been now possible to differentiate the Myth from Truth but this is the ceaseless sequence of the endless education till the end of our end in this COSMOS in the form of Revised or New Editions of our Scientific Textbooks in every branch life.\n\nThere are two greatest discoveries of the all discoveries in whole human history,\n\n1.

Farooq Ahmad Tantary cleared that a confusion is being created among the SSA trs of the state that forum is focusing on other issues like transfer policy & inclusion and it is a deliberate attempt of few miscreants to defame the forum. the reality is that our forum is fighting for these two issues in High court of J&k and hopefully we will win.there is no need of demonstration,and highlighting them in any office,officer or before government. so our only demands are SSA salary & pending confirmation files of RRETs, he also said that on 11th of this month a meeting of forum is scheduled in which strict future course of action will be decided (lockout,protests & indefinite  strike till ssa salary is not linked with state budget) He appealed all the RReTs perticularly SSA trs of the state to be united under one umbrella of JKRETTF   and make 100% participation in the protest programme which will be announced in near future, it will be do or die for us it is a big problem in the state which government is ignoring. Replying to a question raised by ZP GANDERBAL  mr. Syed zahoor Ahmad he said  if all RRETS particularly all SSA trs of the state will stand for their cause and make 100% participation in the protests which will be announced shortly he promised that SSA Salary will not be only dilinked but also will be linked with state's salary head account for ever.He said that I'm not coward or im not making any personal approach with any party I'm only serving my RRETS who made me their leader.he also remembered the past when government issued screening test order and was insisted successfully by JKRETTF   to kneel down before the RRET community..same protests are needed to kneel down the government before SSA trs. He said SSA trs are employees of state government and it is state governments responsibility to pay their salary on time we have nothing to do with central  government or its share which they are paying to state Government as financial assistance.

(The European Commission gives a large number - 74 trillion). These are real values aimed at eliminating the consequences of natural disasters.\nWe divide $ 60 trillion over 30 years of warming and get the annual amount of losses - $ 2 trillion. We divide 2 trillion by the population - 7 billion, and we get that every earthman, from newborns to the elderly, loses $ 286 a year.\nI eliminate the warming for 10 years, and I return to the community (60 divide by 10), 6 billion dollars a year, or 857 dollars each earthling.\nFrom here it is easy to calculate the incomes of any state by the number of people:\nUSA. The population is 325 million people. 325 we multiply by 857, and we receive profit of America - on 278 billion dollars a year.\nAdd here the money that a bunch of Donald Trump - Scott Pruitt thrown in the trash because of the non-implementation of high-yield environmental programs. Quotation: ""For 30 years, losses from cataclysms increased fourfold, or roughly 7% per year. Hence the loss:\nThe GDP of California is 2.003 trillion dollars. Losses - 140 billion dollars a year.\nTexas - 1.644 trillion dollars. Losses - 112 billion.\nNew York - 1.450 trillion dollars. Losses - 101 billion.\nFlorida - 890 billion dollars. Losses - 62 billion This is without taking into account the flooding of Miami Beach, whose assets are estimated at 416 billion dollars.\nFor the rest of the states, I will not count. Each of them will not give $ 20 billion to the treasury, which is $ 920 billion.\nTotal, the negation of warming will cost America in the minus 278, 415, and 920 - at 1.613 trillion dollars a year.\nWhen implementing environmental programs, all the minuses turn into pluses. The profits will be 1.613 trillion dollars a year. And most importantly - the elimination of warming eliminates all kinds of natural disasters in America and the world, and will create conditions for long-term development.\nAs for the resettlement that Hillary Clinton described in a pre-election campaign, the Americans will have nowhere to relocate - the pollution of the atmosphere and poisonous smog will be everywhere: in all countries, in megacities, in country cottages, in bunkers - and in every corner of the planet.\nAddition. The income of the EU will be by the ratio of the number of the population of 325 people in the US, 508 in the EU. The income of the EU will be at 434 billion a year. The income of Germany is 68 billion dollars a year. And so on.\nSincerely, developer of environmental programs, Victor Rodin. Ukraine. (Khmelnitsky NPP). Tel. Kiev Star: 961336344.

(Европейская комиссия дает большое количество - 74 трлн). Это реальные деньги, направленные на устранение последствий стихийных бедствий.\nДелим $ 60 триллионов за 30 лет потепления и получаем годовую сумму потерь - $ 2 трлн. Делим 2 триллиона на население - 7 миллиардов, и получаем, что каждый землянин, от новорожденных до пожилых людей, теряет 286 долларов в год.\nЯ устраняю потепление за 10 лет, и возвращаю сообществу (60 делим на 10), по 6 млрд долларов в год, или по 857 долларов каждому землянину. \n?тсюда легко посчитать доходы любого государства по количеству населения:\n?Ш?. ?аселение составляет 325 миллионов человек. 325 множим на 857, и получаем прибыль ?мерики – по 278 миллиардов долларов в год.\nДобавим сюда деньги, которые связка Дональд ?рамп – ?котт ?руитт выбрасывают на помойку из-за не реализации высокодоходных экологических программ. Цитата: ?За 30 лет убытки от катаклизмов выросли ив четыре раза, или грубо по 7% в год. ?тсюда потери: \n??? Калифорнии – 2,003 трлн долларов. ?отери – 140 млрд долларов в год. \n?ехас – 1,644 трлн долларов. ?отери – 112 млрд. \n?ью-Йорк – 1,450 трлн долларов. ?отери – 101 млрд. \nФлорида – 890 млрд долларов. ?отери – 62 млрд. Это без учёта затопления Майами ?ич, активы которого оцениваются в 416 млрд долларов.\n?о остальным штатам я считать не буду. Каждый их них не даст в казну по 20 млрд, что составит 920 млрд долларов.\nИтого, отрицание потепления обойдётся ?мерике в минус 278, 415, и 920 – в 1,613 трлн долларов в год.\n?ри реализации экологических программ, все минусы переходят в плюсы. ?рибыли составят 1,613 трлн долларов в год. И самое главное – устранение потепления ликвидирует в ?мерике и мире все виды природных катаклизмов, и создаст условия для долгосрочного развития. \nЧто касается переселения, которое красочно описала Хиллари Клинтон в предвыборной компании, то переселять американцам будет некуда – загрязнение атмосферы и ядовитый смог будет везде: во всех странах, в мегаполисах, на загородных дачах, в бункерах – и в каждом уголке планеты. \nДополнение. Доходы Е? будут по соотношению количества населения 325 человек в ?Ш?, – 508 – в Е?. Доход Е? будет составлять по 434 млрд в год. Доход ?ермании – 68 млрд долларов в год.

The environment was created before man was made. \n\n2. The environment can survive without man, it is independent!\n\n3. The environment was created to support humanity. \n\n4.

The earlier we act the better for us all. \n\nThe job is for all of us. The government, International Organisations and Non Governmental Oganisations must work together and be in the fore front to providing the support; awareness, funds, rules and regulations that will regulate industrial externalities and promote clean world. The secondary player which is the (house hold) also have great work to do by thinking green when making purchases and considering eating green.

They sure there are 70% global area are ocean, if hold up one meter sea water on land will cover all land with 2? meter of seawater, this  is wrong! \n There are total 1.34 billions cubic Km seawater.  Cover area 361 millions sq Km. with average depth 3712 m. Ice caps Glaciers & permanent Snow 24 millions cubic Km. if melt 10% will be 2.4 million cu Km, will rise average depth to 3718m, will raised over 4-6m sea level. Most coastal Big Cities Islands are cover with water. There are over 5 millions sq Km of dried lakes, depressions, dead sea, valleys in 33 countries, over 100 locations, most deep under sea level in or by deserts, within 100 Km from sea, ocean, rivers. If filled with one meter of water, will hold up 5 millions cubic Km of water. Will made the average depth to 3698. Lower sea level 10-14 m. fixed flooding problem immediately. There are many shallow beaches coastal line on world actual rate of rising sea level may be much faster than calculation.\nBut only Sahara have over 1.5 millions sq Km of dried salt lakes depressions, if filled with 1.5 m of water, will hold up 2.25 millions cubic Km water, will made the average depth to 3706m. Lower sea level 4-6m. Good enough stop & fixed flooding problem immediately. And turns 1.5 millions sq Km desert area to marine coastal area, Then turned 1.5 millions sq Km  desert temp from over 45C to marine coastal temp 22-32C, lower Sahara temp 5-10C, fixed global warming 2-3C problem immediately. And bringing more moisture rain vegetation deep in desert. More vegetation absorb more CO2 fixed CO2 problem immediately. All cost less a billion dollars and completed within a year.  If support our further invest & develop Sahara project, we can responsible all the expense, and collect produce food energy from Sahara supply local and Europe, resettle refugees ease Europe economics financial problems, prevent EU from further split or collapse.

Vaccines wouldn't be necessary if people had the ability to maintain adequate living conditions to boost their natural immune systems. Even in major cities and suburbs in the U.S. the reason people are urged to use vaccines is because of how we live being an environment that fosters disease. People need proper hygiene, sanitation and nutrition. Industries that pollute our environment and produce products that harm our health, living in huge crowded cities and having a food system dominated by processed foods and gmos is not the environment that is going to allow us to develop properly. Instead of sacrificing those systems and that unsustainable infrastructure, the solution is to treat us like a herd of cattle and recommend vaccines, ignoring that we don't all live uniform lifestyles, our bodies don't respond in a uniform way to the same stimuli and each of us develop and respond uniquely and have different body chemistry so taking the same dosage and a mass produced uniform concoction of harmful chemicals and a synthesized version of the virus is going to eventually be useless like we've seen with antibiotics. It's absolutely ridiculous to criminalize people who choose not to vaccinate. There is no real data being collected on the adverse reactions mild to severe that people suffer with as a result of consuming vaccines. Meanwhile millions of people suffer mild to severe reactions from getting them and nobody has the right to tell anyone else that they have to settle for that suffering when they don't have to. We aren't a herd of cattle. Vaccines aren't the best way or the healthiest way.

The UN must be reformed as a new world binding government to resolve the present crises facing the globe and to adopt the effective remedies for the crises on the line of humanity all over the world. The extreme exploitation of human in the name of inhuman socio-political world order (socalled democracy); the extreme exploitation of human in the name of inhuman socio-economic world order (socalled economic development); and the extreme exploitation of human in name of inhuman/ illusive faith and religions (socalled religions and beliefs) are the root causes for making crises in the present world which are ending the Earth and humanity soon. The seeable and unseeable pre-during and post colonial loot-cultural democracy and loot cultural economic world order is making terror to the globe in fact. The recent development of the neoliberalism and its legacy, democracy, making the world a new slave in the name of the development and democracy, which is burning down the Earth’s assets of humane economic and social brotherhoods all over the world. It is also observed that each and every people across the world is feeling that there is no peace and security and stability; and no prosperity of common-future on this planet due to this inhuman (socio-political = Democracy (of the ….. by the ….. for the ….. with collapsing the Earth/Humane-Culture and Humane Civilizations);  socio-economic = Liberalism or Neoliberalism; and socio-cultural faith = factbaselessness Religion(s)). These main three instruments have been designed and developed to collapse the Humane Civilizations and making the new and modern slavery world order in the days ahead.\n\nThe barbaric deeds:  various great wars, international wars, World Wars I, World War II and genocide of hundreds of thousands of innocent Japanese civilians in 1945, Cambodian Genocides, Vietnam War and genocides, Korean Wars and genocides and Korean blood exploitations making division with North and South, various African genocides since the occupation to till to date, making Africans and other parts of the globe a slave (socio-political, socio-economical and socio-cultural religions) since the occupation to till to date, genocides of Indian American (indigenous people of America), Bangladesh genocides of 60s decade, genocides of Nepal in the name of socalled Maoists insurgency and socalled democracy, North-South American (territorial) wars, various European wars and genocides, Christian–Muslim bloodsheds wars, Mideast wars, North-South (loot economic) wars, Euro-American wars with Muslims,  refugees crises in Europe and America, and among others.\n\nSimilarly, there have been doing barbaric crimes and crimes against humanity on Syria, Iraq, Sudans (North and South), Libya, Israel-Palestine (Arab-Israel), Lebanon, Yemen-Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Ukraine, etc. that are leading the world into the great war, which is finally ending the Earth and humanity very soon. Likewise, the existing inhuman socio-politics, socio-economic and socio-faith is totally collapsing the Earth/Humane-Faith and Humane-Culture and Humane Civilization like Syria (Aasuri=Aasuria=Syria): Syria, its Humane-Culture and Humane Civilization is now being totally destroyed with the creation of ISIS in Syria, Iraq and the region. Boko Haram and like others were created to completely destroy the remaining humane-cultures in Africa continent as well.\n\nFurther, it is also heard and observed on the streets that there are mass killing/arm productions and selling and developing warring-cultures, and militarizing the globe. It is observed on the streets all over the world that this arm producing and warring-culture is the most dangerous factor for humanity because it is cutting stomachs of the global people all over the world and destroying the globe and ending humanity very soon finally. This arm producing and warring-culture is the production of  socalled human that is the most dangerous species (which might have been evolved from dangerous (Satan) species because it never want to see the prosperous of common-future in the world) is destroying the common future of human being and the globe very soon. Likewise, the development of inhuman science and technological innovations are also collapsing the globe and humanity very soon. Further, there are used women as a sex-trading/and child-production-machine in such inhuman society is also the great barrier for humanity in the world that is also pushing to end humanity on the globe very soon. And, the Earth-loot based economy and unearth friendly or anti-Earth life cultural production and consumption systems and its results of the climate change and disasters also pushing us to end from the planet soon finally. \n\nFurthermore, there is also observed that there is done more and more exploitations of the globe by using the Blue Helmet, and, furthermore, there is designed to use the UN as a shield to injecting the existing inhuman world order of so-called development and democracy with destroying the Earth-Cultural humane civilizations and its indigenous knowledge, skills and artefacts, which is also destroying the Earth and common future of us, and it is ending humanity on the Earth consequently. Also, the Blue Helmet has been used as a weapon to legalize to world exploitations and modern slavery on the planet.\n\nIn this condition, there is no meaning of the UN to the 99% of the global people, but 1% percent of the world looter has the meaning of the UN because they are successfully using the UN as the shield of world looting world order. This is the very very challenging issue to the UN, and there is no meaning of the UN until and unless the UN goes to avoid the inhuman/looter’s existing modern slavery world order. \n\nFactually, these crises are, believed to be the possible third world war, killing humanity in the world.

Eradicating drug addiction in all its forms and ramification is a major global challenge and is crutial to ending poverty, hunger, infant mortality, crime and ensuring healthy lives.""\n\nThe greatest challenge I faced as a graduate Psychologist was fixing my younger brother\'s drug addiction problem. It was a very hard nut that I was compelled to launch an investigation into the case. After 15 months of research and observation, I came to understand that DRUG ADDICTION is not what we think it is [you can read the report here https://www.naij.com/1076758-the-surprising-truth-addiction.html ]\n\nThat is not all, I also realised that the very factors militating against global development (hunger, poverty, crime, infant mortality, spread of HIV/AIDS and illiteracy) are to a greater degree influenced by drug addiction. \n\nAbout seventeen years ago, the Millennium Development Goals were agreed, which promised among other goals to end poverty in all its forms everywhere, end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, ensure healthy lives, promote well-being for all (particularly those related to maternal, newborn and child health and reproductive health) in 15years. \n\nThis target was not met, particularly among the most vulnerable (children, youth, persons with disabilities, people living with HIV/AIDS, older persons, indigenous people, internally displaced persons and migrants) in Africa, least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, and small island developing States. These are states suffering from the epidemic of drug abuse and addiction. \n\nAnd it is getting worst... \n\nA research conducted in Nigeria (in 2005) among adolescents reported that 69.3% respondents were abusing psychoactive drugs. With all the war against drug use and trafficking, later research published in 2014 in the Global Journal of Medicine and Public Health (Vol. 3, issue 6) revealed that the consumption of illegal drugs and the harmful use of other psychoactive substances has increased at an alarming rate over the years. It went on to state that Nigeria is the highest consumer of cannabis and amphetamines in Africa. These are the set of people who drop out of school and easily resolve to criminal acts to make ends meet. For every one of these people we fold our arms and watch go down this path of self-destruction,\nThat is one more person we\'ll have to protect ourselves and love ones from. \nThat is one more person who would\'ve become a productive member of the society, \tcreating jobs and solving problems, become enervated. \nThat is one more infant who faces the risk of abuse and malnutrition.  \n\nEvery one of these youngsters are important to us as a people, we must not lose any of them to drugs or any form of abuse. \n\nINTERVENTION\nMy team recognised that eradicating drug abuse in all its forms and ramification is a major global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable growth and development. We also understand that no government or single entity can fight it alone, winning this war requires the collaborative effort of stakeholders, NGOs, the media and everyone and we\'d committed ourselves to this course. We adopted the Matrix Intensive Outpatient Treatment Manual developed by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for this purpose. \n\n10 years ago, we watched drug addicts only in movies, \nBut now, they are our friends, neighbours, and siblings. \n\nIf we bring up just one generation correctly, \nIf we give today ’s children what they need, \nEven to a small extent and encourage them to pass it on, \nGenerations to come will no longer be declining, but ascending. \nOtherwise, generations unborn will sink into despair and drugs;\nWhat a pity for our children."" \n\nSincerely yours, \nSarki Gadah, \nFrom Nigeria.', ""Pur meritevole di rispetto, come direbbe anche #Lenin, l'ascetismo non ? la via delle masse.

It is not possible to get an average (Km/Litre) inside cities due to congestion, red light/ fast moving/slow moving vehicles  and limited space on roads . Number of vehicles is ever increasing. Most of  times the cars are occupied by single person . It means for a single person about 40 -50 square feet of road space is occupied which should not be 5 to 6 square feet. For a single person whose weight along with a bag or briefcase is not more than 100 kg,  a car of 1000 kg is used . It is a wastage of road space, Fuel and time on roads. Time consumed is 3 to 4 time more on roads and just imagine the working hours lost on roads. More smoke in cities due to these slow moving vehicles and more smoke related diseases. \n{{SAVE PRECIOUS TIME FOR PATIENTS ON AMBULANCE BY AVOIDING TRAFFIC JAMS }}\nThe solution lies in reducing the number of Vehicles on roads. Electric Trolley/ capsule with a capacity of one person having a carrying capacity of just 200-250 Kg including weight of person from Home to Office instead of cars having a weight of 1000 Kg is a good option . The excess fuel wasted on moving a car of 1000 kg will be reduced to a large extent, we are just carrying an excess weight of car, about 750- 800 Kg , without any need and wasting fuel on it. The trolleys should start from home and reach the destination /office by GPS on the elevated tracks build at some height above existing roads (May be on the opposite sides of tracks used by elevated metros trains.) . Parking problem can be solved as the /capsules can be parked on top of the building .

During the Conference known as #COP13, more than 190 countries will discuss how to integrate biodiversity into their national policies for agriculture, fishing, and tourism - sectors that benefit greatly from biodiversity but that are also largely responsible for biodiversity loss.

For example: 
- Global benefits from coral reefs including tourism, fisheries and coastal protection are estimated at some $30 billion per year
- Insect pollination of over 40 commercial crops in the United States alone at $30 billion per year
- The international trade of medicinal plants is estimated to be worth around $60 billion per year.

This is no breaking news, besides, there is plenty \nof scientific evidence to support this. Extreme events are proof of this too, and with the \npassing of time such events seem to occur more often, destroying entire populations \nincluding vital means of living jeopardising humanity as a whole. \n\nNevertheless, the old perverse model of production, financing and commercialization as \nwell as the consumption patterns seem to prevail. To mention but a few examples of such \ndependency take a look at the continuous use and abuse of fossil fuels, one of the main \nsources of pollution of our planet. Just look well around yourselves and see how negative \nthe impact is. \n\nAlthough most countries have signed to the COP21 binding agreement finally ratified this \nyear, the economic model mentioned above remains unchanged. Deforestation is \nintensified, the change in the use of land, mega mining projects, fracking, single crop \nfarming in all its variations, all lead to the pollution of river basins and hence all living \nthings. That is to say, the lost of natural ecosystems to sustain life on earth, our source of \nliving, is put at stake due to the greed of a few. In many cases, the rights of indigenous \npeoples are also violated. \n\nReality shows that it is impossible to reduce or maintain the 1.5? C agreed if we do not \nchange the paradigm right now! will it be possible? Of course it will. The new paradigm \nshould be based on ethics and equity, values already tarnished by greedy interests of big \nmultinationals whose sole goal is to make profits. They are the main contributors to global \nwarming. \n\nNow in the COP22, we see a major opportunity to work on a paradigm shift that may \nbenefit the Common Good. Therefore, political leaders shall not give in to pressure from \neconomic groups responsible for climate change and the negative effects that put humanity \nat stake. \n\nToday’s “leaders”, should take the challenge, few things are required: self-control, common \nsense, listening to the scientific community and above all listening to the common man who \nsuffers the damaging consequences of the lack of responsibility. Leaders should think of \nthe common good in order to guarantee sustainability to protect the present and future \ngenerations. We hope that greed is left aside and that the very much needed “Political Will” \nflourishes to sustain a life with dignity and in perfect harmony with Nature. \nOnly in this way so much uncertainty may come to an end. \nAll of us, from here and there, are claiming for an end to apathy.\n\n                                                                           Buenos Aires, November 13 2016\n\nJuan Ortiz Burgos \nPresident \nAsociaci?n Proteger. \nContact: a_proteger@yahoo.com.ar \nRepresentatives in Marrakech -COP22 \nAnthropologist Liliana L M?vil: +33663729014.

It is found that there are the three main root causes responsible for the crisis around the globe. These root causes are: (1) the negative/ neo-liberal/ loot economy/ injustice/ inhuman paradigm of economic world order; (2) the negative/ inhuman paradigm of state sovereignty (limiting humans on the state territory)/ inhuman/ slavery political world order; and (3) the extreme exploitation of human in the name of inhuman/illusive faith and religion. The crisis is ending humanity on the Earth very soon. \nRemedy:\nThe possible outlets for the crisis are: (1) to convert the existing negative/ neo-liberal/ loot economy/ injustice/ inhuman paradigm of economic world order into the new and positive/humane paradigm of equal/justified economic world order; and, do equal sharing of all human being on the global economic productivity and benefits and the equilibrium economic world order; (2) to convert the existing  negative/ inhuman paradigm of state sovereignty (limiting humans on the state territory)/ inhuman/ slavery political world order into the global home/humane paradigm of sovereignty all over the world (people without border)/ freed from the existing slavery political world order/ and to be establishing a new humane political world order all over  the world; and (3) human society must be freed and transformed from the existing extreme exploitation of human in the name of inhuman/illusive faith and religion into the science/fact base faith and religion all over the world.\nMeasure:\nTo get the outlets of the crisis, there should be designed and developed exclusive measures to ensure the common-future of all on the globe. As the first measure, there should be developed the United Nations, as a guardian organization of the globe, must be established as a powerful/supreme organization/ international government (the global governance) to ensure the common-future of all on the globe. \nFinally,\n“Saving the Earth is Saving Humanity: A True Sustainable Development”\nMission:\n“Human Ecology: Mission Sustainable Development through Saving the Earth Saving Humanity”\nSo, \n“Save the Earth, Save Humanity."" - Dr. Shiva Ram Dhakal.

The good news: extreme poverty rates have been cut by more than half since 1990.  However, there are still more than 700 million people living in extreme poverty.  And poverty is not only about a lack of money. It also means not having enough food to eat and limited access to education for so many children.

pass laws, and then turn those laws into reality, 
Ms. Watson said.

Anytime you develop a huge center that center will require more resources and drive the cost up to live near that center. Thus making it unaffordable for the majority and unsustainable because they require more resources. We should be spread out and have space between us. We don't need huge shopping centers in every neighborhood or thousands of homes within a 5 mile radius.  The more open space between homes the better for the planet. We need to balance our existence so we are distributed across the land and get rid of huge cities and urbanization. We don't need huge office buildings. People can have home offices. We need also to build with sustainable materials. We can't keep extracting more minerals and metals, etc from the earth. We shouldn't create any waste that stays forever. It is not really going to do anything but create new problems to develop huge solar farms, to grow modified foods that aren't real or to automate everything. That is only going for require us to increase extraction of resources to develop that infrastructure which then will eventually crumble and deteriorate.

#RuralTransformation #GlobalGoals",,4,34,photo,115,3,0,2,0,0,120,"['It is when we embark on sustainable food production that will fight poverty successfully. But this all sounds impossible in rural areas with poor infrastructure, no sustainable clean water, expensive nurseries to take care of young babies, no electricity where one has to spend hours collecting wood. Our government should make things possible, but where also our leaders are looting from those funds, where really are we going to.', 'In our researches, our work in health, plant and human : ""A discovery provided by my beloved today: A delveing into the origin of seed/nut allergies, especially to peanuts, to soy, and to flax. In my beloved\'s discoveries, they found out that each of these are actually hybrid/ GMO plants that are electrically unsafe because they are an example of electrocuted plants over interbred (which means the nervous systems of the plants are electrocuting not healing genetically). This results in electrocutions of the mouth because the oils of these plants\' oils actually are electricially polluted and instantly fry rancid no matter climate conditions in minutes and thus these nuts oils end up electrocuting the taste buds, the mouth, several inherited body parts (nerves and blood vessels beholding liquid oxygen (and natural inherited electricity) and result in people not being able to breathe. (Though even the inherited bodies pray to stay alive, correctly.). Soy, Peas, and Peanuts for example are actually the nitrogen fixer node/bulbs of the peanut plant, thus if lightening of any small or big varieties concludes they transform the energy into sustancence for the plant. However unhealthy if they are over hybridized plants (like these three are), they harm the soil and individuals who may consume.. My beloved will aid in pieceing the information with anatomy examples (The comparisons and similiarities of Human and Plant anatomies. Including the procautions for both.):\n1.) Nervous system is composed of electricity in all branches and nerves. (Including the electrical nerves upon the inner and upper Skin and all internal/external organs, Heart, Lungs, Brain, immune structures respectfully.). The nerves gather information and remind people, the body and the surroundings of cautionaries and procautions, immune functions as well. The inherited human nerves skeletal structure reminds of the skeletal structure of plants, especially nitrogen fixing plants (which is composed of bulbs (nerves) of electricity cocooned safe, originally. For example: the nitrogen cycle takes in any manner of energy that is electric like the composition of lightening (plasma). Including dark lightening that is not normally seen to the naked eyes. (But sometimes the psychic eyes if the soul of dark lightening wants to be seen that is).\n\nThus the nervous system, composed of electricity, is connected to the electricity held in the RNA (the healing: DNA), and every composition of the body (internal and external organ systems including, like the skin. ) Especially the mitochondria (which are the cells of the body) the nucleus which is recomposed like how a heart in the fetus is born in the womb. The mitochondria beholds water and the RNA (chromosomes= the nucleus of inherited intelligence that carry on all specific healing functions in the body. It has an immune system composed of a cardiovascular system, a lymphatic system and a electric nervous system that operate together to heal functionally, where fire and water are synthesized in balance= The water and electricity together. )\n\n2.) The Cardiovascular system is the second heart of the nervous system, composed of water and fire (as well) in all veins, muscles, and mitochondria. The blood, especially the red blood cells and the white blood cells (in example all functioning gifts of the immunity system) have this, including RNA. My beloved one refers to these as the mitochondrial presences, the white blood cells who work on behalf of the nervous system and the red blood cells relate to the presence power of the heart (nucleus). To Heal together.   3.) Thus, as the nervous system is highly electric sourced, and so are the seas of the cardiovascular system as well, they operate functioningly together. Very closely. The concern thus is, what if a foreign material of metal (such as silver or concerningly hybrid, interbred, or rot fermented metals) or glass ( an example of plastic) were to puncture the skin (mitochondrial cells) and into the combination of the nervous system cocooning the cardiovascular system? In example they say never put metal (like silver) to raw electricity (like lightening) otherwise it’s very harmful in consequences to any number of individuals. What if the material of metal or glass-like material was coated in liquid? Inside and out (if the material of metal or glass is a container of contents liquid). What if the metal/glass was coated in the sterilization of alcohol? Do they not say (especially with any similarity to nail polish remover, that the ingredients are alcohol based and are very flammable if flame or (plasma) electricity (which is raw fire) is near? ). It would be the same then, if alcohol touches/coats a needle, supposable to sterilize, however what if the sterilization alcohol was on a vaccination needle, an electric tattoo needle or on an epi-pen needle and it punctures any layer of the cardiovascular system veins and a nerve of electricity of the nervous system? Would that not still electrocute someone especially if the container of contents ends up pouring into the cardiovascular system, lymphatic and worsen the electrocution of the electricity of the nervous system if puncturing too deep? That would not be a game to muse over, like playing god with electricity! It would be the intelligence of the body (the very nucleus (the heart) trying to work together like a living prayer field in action. Because the whole of the body is a living consciousness of intelligence (soul and spirit) of energy. Thus the whole body works together as a living morphogenetic field (Which means it is the living soul of all of the immune system healing together. Including with higher source energy (universe, divine energy, etc in names) which is connected to the electromagnetic field of the earth, the sun and moon (The Earth’s Nervous system, the Moon’s nervous system, the Sun’s nervous system that connects to the human bodies’ nervous systems. Reminds of a woven placenta, many fold. ). It all works together in stability, to keep out the contents of the “allergy test” or any dangers because the body knows it’s toxic. The epi-pen’s injecting needle, an allergy test, electric needles for tattoos on the skin (even fake tattoo ingrediants), and nitrogen fixing plant material consumed as food or beverage as well. Thus in everyones inherited body design, the energetic conscious of the body is praying to heal every individual on all levels. Most especially electrically and with the waters as well, together. This is Dr. Emoto’s water theory, and naturally an inherited law of the ancient cultures to respect anatomy we inherit. It does not mean, all people are lost, No!

Because the body/ presence is telling everyone each and clearly, that those things (similar to the formation of glass and harmful needle structures, big or small) are electrocuting the inherited anatomy, especially of the lungs (which highly have the bulbs of the nerves of the nervous system in them including the heart, stomache and brain. As hybrid foods are, unfortunately electrocuted junks as they were interbred very incorrectly in their original born anatomies. Hybridizing the plants electrocutes their RNA, their nerves system combined and thus they are not of nourishment nutrition. All nutrition is electrocuted and rancid in hybrid gmo food/drinks”, and too often as hybrid plants are most often flammable (due to their nitrogen warped genetic nervous systems) and create acid erosion in the soil and water and in the digestive system like a form of botulistic alcohol burning through the stomache lining (intestines, kidneys, heart, etc) into the nervous system for humans and animals as well.

The Iran-contra affair was the product of two separate initiatives during the administration of President Ronald Reagan. The first was a commitment to aid the contras who were conducting a guerrilla war against the Sandinista government of Nicaragua. The second was to placate ""moderates"" within the Iranian government in order to secure the release of American hostages held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon and to influence Iranian foreign policy in a pro-Western direction.\n\nDespite the strong opposition of the Reagan administration, the Democratic-controlled Congress enacted legislation, known as the Boland amendments, that prohibited the Defense Dept., the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), or any other government agency from providing military aid to the contras from Dec., 1983, to Sept., 1985. The Reagan administration circumvented these limitations by using the National Security Council (NSC), which was not explicitly covered by the law, to supervise covert military aid to the contras. Under Robert McFarlane (1983–85) and John Poindexter (1985–86) the NSC raised private and foreign funds for the contras. This operation was directed by NSC staffer Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North. McFarlane and North were also the central figures in the plan to secretly ship arms to Iran despite a U.S. trade and arms embargo.\n\nIn early Nov., 1986, the scandal broke when reports in Lebanese newspapers forced the Reagan administration to disclose the arms deals. Poindexter resigned before the end of the month; North was fired. Select congressional committees held joint hearings, and in Dec., 1986, Lawrence E. Walsh was named as special prosecutor to investigate the affair. Higher administration officials, particularly Reagan, Vice President Bush, and William J. Casey (former director of the CIA, who died in May, 1987), were implicated in some testimony, but the extent of their involvement remained unclear. North said he believed Reagan was largely aware of the secret arrangement, and the independent prosecutor\'s report (1994) said that Reagan and Bush had some knowledge of the affair or its coverup. Reagan and Bush both claimed to have been uninformed about the details of the affair, and no evidence was found to link them to any crime. A presidential commission was critical of the NSC, while congressional hearings uncovered a web of official deception, mismanagement, and illegality.\n\nA number of criminal convictions resulted, including those of McFarlane, North, and Poindexter, but North\'s and Poindexter\'s were vacated on appeal because of immunity agreements with the Senate concerning their testimony. Former State Dept. and CIA officials pleaded guilty in 1991 to withholding information about the contra aid from Congress, and Caspar Weinberger, defense secretary under Reagan, was charged (1992) with the same offense. In 1992 then-president Bush pardoned Weinberger and other officials who had been indicted or convicted for withholding information on or obstructing investigation of the affair. The Iran-contra affair raised serious questions about the nature and scope of congressional oversight of foreign affairs and the limits of the executive branch.\n\nSee B. Woodward, Veil (1987); T.

""When I was born, my parents didn’t record the date of my birth. Families were understandably worried that babies would not survive. Therefore, they waited until they are sure that these babies are able to survive. That’s why my passport date of birth is actually different from my real [one]. My wife’s birth date is also different. ... I understand that in some countries that kind of practice still persists. All births and deaths must be registered.

Africa is such a potent land of natural resources, the amount of heat there will continuously be replenishing the mineral ore. When at a high temperature carbon can be converted into Q-carbon, why not continuous heat for period of time convert a base material in the land into a metal or mineral? \n\nThe Heat can be used to produce energy using the concept of thermoelectricity, a concept that converts atmospheric heat into electricity. Energy production through thermoelectricity is much promising and long-lasting than the solar energy that depends on sunlight and the presence of photons on the panels. A concentre slab would easily absorb water even in night, this evinces the capacity of heat retention or warmth even in the absence of sun and the production of thermoelectricity at all days round. \n\nWhen the heat accumulated is converted into energy, transfer of hot and cool temperatures between the layers of the earth will be smooth that will extend the cultivable areas from the banks and coastal side to further centre of the region.\n\nProsperity of Africa is not in technology and infrastructure but in NATURE.

You need people who knows what to do and not who knows only how to talk. Good Luck climate change. I wish the heart and mind of everyone will be eventually changed.

Their most obvious characteristic is their large, flat, toothed snout which makes up about one quarter of the total length of the animal. They use it to stir prey up from the seabed and to attack mid-water shoals of fish, stun and kill them. Incidental capture in trawls and gillnets is the primary threat to sawfish and has led to severe population declines. 

All five species are classed as Endangered or Critically Endangered. Five species of sawfish listed on CMS Appendices in 2014 may be added to the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks, being discussed this week in Costa Rica. #SharksMOU #SharksMOS2 IUCN Shark Specialist Group

The transmission of the right kind of information, energy and human development potential to source is the most important effort of all in achieving any human development goal.\n\nIf nothing is ever enough, then close to enough is better!

In that case, goals 2, 3, 4 become embodied in 1 as specific numbers. As stipulated by goal 17, commitments can be measured on a global scale, based on numbers that seek to balance global human development.\n\nInfrastructure development should be a separate goal (# 2) where the key infrastructure is clean electricity (with ""developing countries"" target installed capacity in Gigawatts, measured on per capita basis) as even more relevant to least developing countries. In that regard, goals 1 - 17 are also embodied in infrastructure development and could all be merged as 1 goal, with a special focus on electricity generation infrastructure in developing countries! The installed capacity TARGET should be based on the capacity for the average electricity consumption of at least 2000 KWh per capita in developing countries. In that regard, all other SDG\'s can be achieved.\n\nThe next goal (#3) will then be GLOBAL environmental stewardship, with emphasis on each person planting a tree in his lifetime and making sure it lived! It is a matter of getting information around as a complete picture, for people to see where they belong in the overall plan, and one needs electricity to make that possible.\n\nSuch should be the sustainable development goals. They should be bound by specific numbers.

It is a scientific fact that climate change is due primarily to the human use of fossil fuels, which releases carbon dioxide(CO2) and other greenhouse gases into the air. The gases trap heat within the atmosphere, which can have a range of effects on ecosystems, including rising sea levels, severe weather events, and droughts that render landscapes more susceptible to wildfires.\n\nTo many the issue of climate change does not in any way make sense, to them it is largely a scientific fiction aimed at scaring and forbidding them in exploring and enjoying the fullest gift that nature as to offer, while even if it makes sense to YOU or not, the fact is that it is AFFECTING YOU and ME…all!\n\nDay after day, the consequences or an effect of this simple reality (CLIMATE CHANGE) keeps flooding-in with force from every angle. Is it the cover pages of Newspaper, Magazines, Social Medias, TV programmes e.t.c. Even if you care or not, the evident reports of increasing rate of disasters (flooding, hunger, drought), new diseases (that I called them International diseases cause they seems not to respect borders), War, oh, yes! I say WAR (I will surely one day write WAR and CLIMATE CHANGE) e.t.c What propelled me to write this is simply our PERCEPTION TOWARDS DISASTERS AND RISKS in this part of the world---- AFRICA!. Many of us perceived the alarming rate of global disasters as simple “AN ACT OF GOD”! While is it true that everything happens because GOD permit them to but it is also true that there is a PERMISSIBLE WILL OF GOD and PERFECT WILL OF GOD. That means that even the theologians understood the fact the sometimes GOD allows some certain things to happen due to mainly our action and activities In and on the environment, mind you that include the topic of CLIMATE CHANGE!!!!!\n\nFrances Harris in his book titled “Global Environmental Issues” pointed out the need for global synergy in tacking this Issue because to him this requires LOCAL ACTION aimed at achieving a GLOBAL RESULT. Govind Prasad published the Hand Book of Conservation Biology and suggested BIOSEQUESTRATION as the key in absorbing, storing and utilizing the atmospheric Carbon (CO2), a greenhouse gas.\n\nMan has realized the fact that he is heading towards a catastrophic end and according Prof. S. S. Sanusi he is left with two option 1. To Change his approach and methods of dealing with the environment or 2. To DIE with the Environment. UNEP suggested mitigation and adaptation as the key in combating Climate Change. To UNEP adaptation is the best, cause once a community or individual adapt to the ever changing environmental parameters the better the chances for survival. To me, personally, I say, NO! cause there is a point beyond resilient where the system can withstand the change talk more of coming back to its former state.\n\nToday, all I want from YOU is a simple act of conservation our planet! Plant flowers, trees and involve in GREEN DESIGN, reduce your fossil fuel consumption (trek where possible)…. And help in educating your neighbours! We are all in this! Together we can save our Planet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nTo be continued........\nMNB (www.twitter.com/ngwason)', 'PEACE AND FORGIVENESS IN GOD\'S NAME IN HEAVEN; Its a principle (not pride) not to visit the unep website and nothing ever changes my mind.

Because of this, Wade is considered among the RARE African leaders who are committed to democracy.

Make a difference and Watch Hunger Stop with the World Food Programme: http://mko.rs/VL",,2,8,photo,21,0,0,0,0,0,21,"['Food insecurity is  a great risk for health in Canada for First Nation households on-reserve (Chan et al. 2011, 2012, Fieldhouse and Thompson 2013, Lawn and Harvey 2004) as well as off-reserve (Willows et al. 2009, 2011; Taraskuk et al. 2013). Household food insecurity rates in First Nation communities greatly surpass the Canadian average of 9.2 % and rates for sub-population groups such as the lowest income adequacy quintile (55%), social assistance recipients (62%) and off-reserve Aboriginals (33%)  (Health Canada, 2006).  Studies in northern Manitoba and northern Ontario reveal very high rates with all of these studies indicating food insecurity rates are above 75% (Lawn and Harvey, 2004a; Lawn and Harvey, 2004b; Thompson et al, 20012). Recent research shows that 41% of First Nation households on-reserve in B.C. and 38% of First Nation households on-reserves in Manitoba are food insecure: food insecurity rates range from 16% in southern First Nations to 73% in the northern communities.  However, a national study of food security in First Nation communities is not available and was not part of the Health Canada study in 2004 and 2009 for all non-First Nation communities.\nProvisioning of country foods has been negatively impacted by many factors. These factors include: disruption of cultural transmission by residential schools; restrictions prohibiting the sale of wild fish and meat which has not been inspected at southern based federal food processors, and, poverty limiting the ability to buy the necessary gear (e.g., nets, boats, rifles, snowmobiles etc.), as well as to buy market food. \nPoor quality food environments amplify individual risk factors for obesity, food insecurity, and may explain some racial and socio-economic inequalities  in health and nutritional outcomes. There are also linkages to missing and murdered women – as the need to feed the family when in poverty puts women at risk. Household food insecurity is reflected in unhealthy dietary patterns such as the low intake of fruits and vegetables and is recognized as an important public health concern in Canada. Food-related health problems include heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, distress, depression, low immunity levels, dental caries and anemia. Elevated food insecurity rates may explain why Manitoba has the highest rate of pediatric diabetes in North America, particularly in the four Ojibway-Cree First Nation communities. \nTreaties were meant to ensure access to sustainable livelihoods and food security from country foods but subsistence economies have been undermined and undervalued for their critical role in ensuring food security.  The decline of hunting for food has increased the reliance on store-bought food and adoption of characteristic southern dietary habits associated with obesity, dental caries, anemia, lowered resistance to infection, diabetes and food insecurity. Nobel laureate Amartya Sen (1983) in his groundbreaking ‘Poverty and Famines: An Essay of Entitlement and Deprivation’ theorizes: “a person is reduced to starvation if some change occurs either in his endowment (e.g., alienation of land, loss of labor power, ill health) or in his exchange entitlement (e.g., fall in wages, rise in food prices, loss of employment, drop in price of foods he produces)” (p. 45).\nThis food insecurity is unjust and requires immediate interventions to support country food programs and other interventions proven to support food security. Each public health authority should put in place a mandate to put in place a food security plan.  As well, a monitoring program for Food Security should be done annually or bi-annually for First Nation communities until the rates are on par with the Canadian public. Food security and its consequences cannot be ignored any longer.\n\nSincerely:\n\nReferences\nBeaumier M, Ford J.

Inform Madam Sylvie Mwichuli besides your team too!', 'Dear partners\nPippi house is a complete solution for girls who without financial help will have very small chances of gaining education, self-sufficiency, marriage and other things that we all want for our children. Right now we have 11 girls staying with us. They are between 15 and 24 years old. Our work method is similar to having foster children. Social workers build them psychologically and socially, Pippi house also receive English speaking volunteers from abroad on a regular basis. We provide longtime accommodation for three years with comfortable beds, good food, education, domestic skills and time for resting. There are today many different kinds of NGO-centers specialized in one specific area. Because of the tuff conditions the girls comes from, offering one service is often not enough for a sustainable positive development. Offering a complete solution helps the girls to focus on their schoolwork.\n\n    Pippi girls at one picture      Living as a family at pippi house,                               First Day in Uniform to school.\n   Our target group\nOur target group has a high risk of diseases like HIV, alcoholism or getting a baby they can’t take good care of. The causes differ: poverty, abuse, lack of adult guidance. A lot of girls in Tanzania have good lives with caring parents, a home they attend school or a job. Our target group is the girls who do not. Homeless forced into labor or neglected by their parents. Girls who run away from home because of poverty, violence or similar problems often end up suffering from more violence then they eloped from. When teenage girls have run away there is often a long way back home. This is one of the goals of Pippi house: to help teenage girls reunite with their families. \nA common situation for teenage girls in Tanzania is to be working as housemaids. Anyone who is not in school and who is not supported by ones family needs to work for a living. However being an analphabetic will keep them and their future children in a cycle of poverty. We strongly encourage all employers of housemaids to offer to pay for their education. Here in Tanzania having had one employment is often not enough to gain a second job, these girls are very vulnerable when they are let go. \n\n Volunteer Teaching,                           Girls on the way to school,                  Girls leaning how to make shanga,\nThe importance of girl’s education\n Rev.Aristides Nshange: After having worked with street boys for many years I found two things. Their mothers are often analphabetic and the fathers are often alcoholics. Educated girls are not in the same way at risk of their children running away from home. I find there to be a mentality with the idea that girls are not serious and that this would make it difficult to help them. From my experience I find this untrue. Girls who are given a fair chance to go to school are working very hard to succeed in their results. However; the consequences from malnutrition, psychological wounds and worrying can affect boys and girls in different ways. With supervision, guidance, instructions and motivation girls can do as well as their male classmates. \nThere is a stigma around marrying uneducated women starting a negative spiral of shame where there should be encouragement and love for one another. Educated women are respected by the society and they are considered good wives and mothers. This makes them role models for young people showing them there is a way of fighting poverty. We most welcome committed women who have managed to do the journey from being less privileged in childhood to succeeding in adulthood. Come and visit us and inspire our girls!\nMothers spend a lot of time with their children; by being educated they are able to do so in a way that will strengthen the next generation of our country. Our girls will be able to teach their children English, math, the sky is the limit! Educated women often have fewer children then their fellow sisters, which increase their possibility to provide for their children’s basic needs and future education. \n\n      Girls back from school,\t Girls dancing at pippi house,                     Girls after Netball field,\nEducated staff\nThe Pippi house staff consists of educated social workers with long experience from working with children at risk. The mother of the house has been working with Kishari boys home, Impact Kilimanjaro and Watoto foundation for many years. The fathers of the house have been working as a manager at Watoto foundation. As any social work we work with clients who have been threw a lot of challenges and unwanted experiences. It is crucial that our girls are being protected from further exposure to risk behaviors, but also people who can cause them harm by intention. We take this assignment very seriously. \n\nVolunteers’ visiting Girls                 , Volunteer Teaching Girls at pippi,         Founder& Director .pippi house,\nWe have volunteers coming here on a regular basis teaching the girls English, computer skills and math.\n\nFuture goals and needs\nWe want to expand our exclusive idea into other regions. Today our centre is located in Arusha, in the future we wish there to be similar centers in Iringa, Mbeya,Tanga, Bukoba, Manyara Morogoro and Singida. These are the cities we find most affected with girls child labour. Another of Pippi house future goals is to be a role model for others, similar organizations. Slowly starting up sustainable safe houses. \nThe girls staying at Pippi will be empowered to help other girls succeed the same way they will.

Casteism is the most horrible form of Racism, as this inhuman Caste System torments these marginalize people by treating them as ""Untouchables"" (i.e. inferior to even animals). The thousands years old inhuman Caste System of Hinduism builds the cruel mentality (from very childhood) among the privileged dominant castes (upper castes) that exploitation of deprived marginalized helpless people (Depressed Castes or Dalits) is their right & a social custom. So, Casteism generates & cultivates the exploitation based brutal practices against Depressed Castes; Hence, Casteism is the root cause of widespread inhuman practices against India\'s Depressed Castes (with population of 300 million), like - slavery, human rights denial, inequality, untouchability, brutalities, child exploitation, child labour, woman exploitation, rapes, forced prostitution, bonded/forced labour, human trafficking, manual scavenging, socio-economic marginalization, corruption, land grabbing (including agricultural & forest land protected by marginalized/tribal people), mal-nutrition, hunger, non-provision of health/medical facilities, discrimination & persecution against executives/workers at work place (offices), discrimination against students in educational institutions, discrimination in employment/recruitment, etc etc. .....In order to eliminate these inhuman practices, Casteism should be eliminated, taking up them on top priority at international level, forcing legal/criminal action against casteist oppressors, who so far enjoy impunity despite existence of certain casteism prevention laws (impunity has been noted & condemned by various studies & reports of UN & other international human rights agencies, repeatedly, but sadly, still no moves to stop this injustice).']"

Despite the terrible intensity of this thousands years old tyrade (Caseism), UN\'s action so far has been restricted only to studies, reports & advices. Casteism dominated indian society has never cared for Studies/Reports/Advices based casteism ellimination efforts of world community, UN or any human rights / justice favouring agency and carries out this systematic ruthless inhuman practice (in various direct & indirect forms) in unabated manner with blatant ignorance of all concerns of human rights community, as the prevailing system gives the casteist oppressors a wide scope to go unpunished & unconvicted despite all complaints of victim, howsoever the crime may be serious. Hence, Studies/Reports/Advices of UN have always failed to make any impact on the pathetic situation of caste based marginalization, discrimination & persecution of helpless depressed castes & tribes (300 million dalits). Therefore, this situation of inaction by UN against Casteism in India is responsible for the continuous systematic persecution of dalits by dominant caste (upper caste hindu) oppressors and for prevailing situation of denial of justice to casteism victims. ....WILL UN START ANY JUSTICE ENFORCEMENT ACTION EVER AGAINST THIS THOUSANDS YEARS OLD INHUMAN PRACTICE OF CASTEISM (which is in fact more horrible than Racism) ??? ------------------------------------------- Casteism (Caste Based Discrimination, which is the most horrible form of Racism) is an inhuman evil, where the victims (marginalized depressed castes/tribes people - Dalits) are bound to suffer discrimination & persecution even after getting education because the dominant caste people, having thousands years old deep rooted poison of Caste Apartheid in their minds, force discriminatory practices even against educated people of marginalized castes, to impead their growth and to keep them at the lowest strata of the society for ever (Inhuman Caste System of India/Hinduism, categorizes & treats dalits as ""Untouchables"" i.e. inferior to even animals, and denies them all basic human rights, forcing religious-social rules of doing inhuman occupations upon Dalits, like - manually cleaning the filth of people & carrying human excreta, cleaning sewers & drains, carrying dead animals & removing their skins, crushing stones, etc. These inhuman occupations have been forced upon depressed castes (dalits), for thousands years, generations after generations, denying them education and good jobs, making a system where the children of dalits are forced to do the slavery occupations of their fathers & forefathers). In the absence of honest justice enforcement system, this holocast against helpless voiceless dalits, goes on and on without any prevention. Despite the enactment of certain Casteism prevention laws, the system of Caste Based Discrimination/Persecution, practically goes on unabated and oppressors go unpunished, as the voice (complaints) of dalit victims go unheard everywhere. .............

From face book\nPoor maternal, newborn and child health remains a significant problem in developing countries. Worldwide, 358 000 women die during pregnancy and childbirth every year and an estimated 7.6 million children die under the age of five. The majority of maternal deaths occur during or immediately after childbirth. The common medical causes for maternal death include bleeding, high blood pressure, prolonged and obstructed labor, infections and unsafe abortions. A child’s risk of dying is highest during the first 28 days of life when about 40% of under-five deaths take place, translating into three million deaths. Up to one half of all newborn deaths occur within the first 24 hours of life and 75% occur in the first week. Globally, the main causes of neonatal death are preterm birth, severe infections and asphyxia. Children in low-income countries are nearly 18 times more likely to die before the age of five than children in high-income countries.\n\nIt is a sacred responsibility of every male member of a civilize society to be concerned in the Maternal period of our respected Women it must be a prime duty to ensure that this women will be care in the highest standard attention. Forget the dominant attitude of some male of being proud as breed winner, Macho effect and doesn’t care for women’s affair that thinking exist only in the time of Conan the barbarian. Together we can make change everybody could contribute in achieving this goal to eradicate maternal death among Maranao  Women and new born deaths of course being a Muslim we all adhere to our religious belief that all is in the hands of ALLAH no one had the power to change what Allah have destined. Amal  or action is given to us, guidelines make clear to us by our beloved PROPHET (SWW) That our paradise lies in the feet of our Mothers who happened to be a woman. I’m not here to deliver religious sermon but an appeal to join me and let us make history and make Ranao zero of maternal mortality as a result of poor maternal and new born child management.\nThese are the following action to be done:\n\tMass Communication  to the objectives of the cause\n\tMass involvement of our people and make understand the message\n\tEnsure that every pregnant woman will get proper medical services established data center to record individual pregnant woman history to be done by barangay (village)official, or designation of barangay(village) midwife the involvement of our barangay(village) officials are very essential to this project.\n\tEnsure presence of midwife in time of delivery or patience is in Hospital if necessary.\n\nBy our joint efforts  INSALLAH (if God willing ) we can achieved this goal in line with the United Nation Millennium GOALS of 2015  Improved Maternal Health and reduce Child Mortality.\nCLOSE\nPlease keep in touch and like this manifest.', 'what have gender equality achieved in USA?
